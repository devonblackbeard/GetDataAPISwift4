# GetDataAPISwift4
App that retrieves data from an API and displays in a table view. 

Each row contains the name of a person, and clicking that name will present an alert to the user. The user can either cancel, or click 'View More'. The latter will present a new, drilled down table view showing additional properties of the person. Clicking these rows will not do anything.

From here, the user has the option to go back to the homescreen. 




Language Used: Swift 4
Version XCode: 10.3
